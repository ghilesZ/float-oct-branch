  Linear constraint.

  The linear slope is chosen so that it canbot be represented
  exactly in the box or octagon domain.

  Works with boxes for tick bound (e.g., 30).
  Works with various increment range for time.
  Larger bounds require more --max-refinement-steps
  Does not work with octagons.

  A main issue is that the values of tick are discrete but the solver
  is for continuous domains only.
